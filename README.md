## Description:
-This application is a react js deployment that contains a professional portfolio for myself Benjamin Kerby. It show cases an aboutme section, a portfolio of my works, a contact form, and my resume. The application itself shows a skillset of react js and css. I personally enjoyed making this and showcasing some of my interests.
